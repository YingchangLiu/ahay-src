    abstract = { Seismic coherency is a measure of lateral changes in the seismic response caused by variation in structure, stratigraphy, lithology, porosity, and the presence of hydrocarbons. Unlike shaded relief maps that allow 3-D visualization of faults and channels from horizon picks, seismic coherency operates on the seismic data itself and is therefore unencumbered by interpreter or automatic picker biases. We present a more robust, multitrace, semblance‐based coherency algorithm that allows us to analyze data of lesser quality than our original three‐trace cross‐correlation‐based algorithm. This second‐generation, semblance‐based coherency algorithm provides improved vertical resolution over our original zero mean crosscorrelation algorithm, resulting in reduced mixing of overlying or underlying stratigraphic features. In general, we analyze stratigraphic features using as narrow a temporal analysis window as possible, typically determined by the highest usable frequency in the input seismic data. In the limit, one may confidently apply our new semblance‐based algorithm to a one‐sample‐thick seismic volume extracted along a conventionally picked stratigraphic horizon corresponding to a peak or trough whose amplitudes lie sufficiently above the ambient seismic noise. In contrast, near‐vertical structural features, such as faults, are better enhanced when using a longer temporal analysis window corresponding to the lowest usable frequency in the input data. The calculation of reflector dip/azimuth throughout the data volume allows us to generalize the calculation of conventional complex trace attributes (including envelope, phase, frequency, and bandwidth) to the calculation of complex reflector attributes generated by slant stacking the input data along the reflector dip within the coherency analysis window. These more robust complex reflector attribute cubes can be combined with coherency and dip/azimuth cubes using conventional geostatistical, clustering, and segmentation algorithms to provide an integrated, multiattribute analysis. }

    abstract = { Coherence measures applied to 3-D seismic data volumes have proven to be an effective method for imaging geological discontinuities such as faults and stratigraphic features. By removing the seismic wavelet from the data, seismic coherence offers interpreters a different perspective, often exposing subtle features not readily apparent in the seismic data. Several formulations exist for obtaining coherence estimates. The first three generations of coherence algorithms at Amoco are based, respectively, on cross correlation, semblance, and an eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix. Application of these three generations to data from the Gulf of Mexico indicates that the implementation of the eigenstructure approach described in this paper produces the most robust results. This paper first introduces the basic eigenstructure approach for computing coherence followed by a comparison on data from the Gulf of Mexico. Next, Appendix A develops a theoretical connection between the well‐known semblance and the less well‐known eigenstructure measures of coherence in terms of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. Appendix B further extends the analysis by comparing the semblance- and eigenstructure‐based coherence measures in the presence of additive uncorrelated noise. }

    abstract = { ABSTRACTNumerous types of fault attributes have been proposed to detect faults by measuring reflection continuities or discontinuities. However, these attributes can be sensitive to other seismic discontinuities, such as noise and stratigraphic features. In addition, fault features within a fault attribute image often cannot be continuously tracked. We have developed an optimal surface-voting method to enhance a fault attribute image so that the noisy features (unrelated to faults) are suppressed whereas the fault features become cleaner and more continuous. In this method, we first automatically pick seed points from the input attribute image and use these seeds as control points to compute optimal surface patches that pass through the control points and follow globally maximum fault attribute values. Then, we consider all the computed surfaces as voters and define voting scores for each voter by using fault attribute values that are smoothed along the surface voter. We further collect voting scores of all the voters to compute a voting score map as a new fault attribute image, in which fault features (with high scores) are much cleaner, sharper, and more continuous than those in the input attribute image. With the optimal surface voters, we can also accurately estimate fault orientations (strikes and dips) by computing weighted averages of the surface voter orientations. From a voting score map with clean and continuous fault features, fault surfaces can be extracted by tacking the fault features along the estimated fault orientations. The computational cost of the method depends on the number of seed points, not the size of the seismic volume, which makes the method highly efficient. With an four-core computer, our parallel implementation can process more than 1000 seeds in 1 s to compute the corresponding optimal voting surfaces and a final voting score map. }

    abstract = { For hydrocarbon exploration, large volumes of data are acquired and used in physical modeling-based workflows to identify geologic features of interest such as fault networks, salt bodies, or, in general, elements of petroleum systems. The adjoint modeling step, which transforms the data into the model space, and subsequent interpretation can be very expensive, both in terms of computing resources and domain-expert time. We propose and implement a unique approach that bypasses these demanding steps, directly assisting interpretation. We do this by training a deep neural network to learn a mapping relationship between the data space and the final output (particularly, spatial points indicating fault presence). The key to obtaining accurate predictions is the use of the Wasserstein loss function, which properly handles the structured output — in our case, by exploiting fault surface continuity. The promising results shown here for synthetic data demonstrate a new way of using seismic data and suggest more direct methods to identify key elements in the subsurface. }

To provide a computer-based aid in addressing this challenge, we have developed a “big data” platform to facilitate the work of geophysicists in interpreting and analyzing large volumes of seismic data with scalable performance. We have constructed this platform on a modern distributed-memory infrastructure, providing a customized seismic analytics software development toolkit, and a Web-based graphical workflow interface along with a remote 3D visualization capability. These support the management of seismic data volumes, attributes processing, seismic analytics model development, workflow execution, and 3D volume visualization on a scalable, distributed computing platform. Early experiences show that computationally demanding deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide improved results over traditional methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression for identifying geologic faults in 3D seismic volumes. Our experiments show encouraging accuracy in identifying faults by combining CNN and traditional machine learning models with a variety of seismic attributes, and the platform is able to deliver scalable performance. }

    abstract = { ABSTRACTDelineating faults from seismic images is a key step for seismic structural interpretation, reservoir characterization, and well placement. In conventional methods, faults are considered as seismic reflection discontinuities and are detected by calculating attributes that estimate reflection continuities or discontinuities. We consider fault detection as a binary image segmentation problem of labeling a 3D seismic image with ones on faults and zeros elsewhere. We have performed an efficient image-to-image fault segmentation using a supervised fully convolutional neural network. To train the network, we automatically create 200 3D synthetic seismic images and corresponding binary fault labeling images, which are shown to be sufficient to train a good fault segmentation network. Because a binary fault image is highly imbalanced between zeros (nonfault) and ones (fault), we use a class-balanced binary cross-entropy loss function to adjust the imbalance so that the network is not trained or converged to predict only zeros. After training with only the synthetic data sets, the network automatically learns to calculate rich and proper features that are important for fault detection. Multiple field examples indicate that the neural network (trained by only synthetic data sets) can predict faults from 3D seismic images much more accurately and efficiently than conventional methods. With a TITAN Xp GPU, the training processing takes approximately 2 h and predicting faults in a 128×128×128 seismic volume takes only milliseconds. }

We add a spatial dropout layer between the encoder and the decoder to quantify the uncertainty of model parameters. To analyze where the model pays attention to when segmenting each label in the seismic volume, we apply the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) by using the gradients flowing into each layer of the neural network. By having multiple labels, the network successfully detects two channel facies as well as faults, and reduces confusion between channel boundaries and faults in the results. Uncertainties from the spatial dropout layer aid interpreters understanding and enhancing the outputs from neural network. Grad-CAM outputs show that the network captures some human-understandable concepts from seismic volumes, for features segmentation. }

We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators.

    abstract = { ABSTRACTSeismic structural interpretation involves highlighting and extracting faults and horizons that are apparent as geometric features in a seismic image. Although seismic image processing methods have been proposed to automate fault and horizon interpretation, each of which today still requires significant human effort. We improve automatic structural interpretation in seismic images by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that recently have shown excellent performances in detecting and extracting useful image features and objects. The main limitation of applying CNNs in seismic interpretation is the preparation of many training data sets and especially the corresponding geologic labels. Manually labeling geologic features in a seismic image is highly time-consuming and subjective, which often results in incompletely or inaccurately labeled training images. To solve this problem, we have developed a workflow to automatically build diverse structure models with realistic folding and faulting features. In this workflow, with some assumptions about typical folding and faulting patterns, we simulate structural features in a 3D model by using a set of parameters. By randomly choosing the parameters from some predefined ranges, we are able to automatically generate numerous structure models with realistic and diverse structural features. Based on these structure models with known structural information, we further automatically create numerous synthetic seismic images and the corresponding ground truth of structural labels to train CNNs for structural interpretation in field seismic images. Accurate results of structural interpretation in multiple field seismic images indicate that our workflow simulates realistic and generalized structure models from which the CNNs effectively learn to recognize real structures in field images. }

However, when applied to seismic inversion, the shortage of labeled data severely influences the performance of deep learning-based methods. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel seismic impedance inversion method based on a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN). The proposed Cycle-GAN model includes two generative subnets and two discriminative subnets. Three kinds of loss, including cycle-consistent loss, adversarial loss, and estimation loss, are adopted to guide the training process. Benefit from the proposed structure, the information contained in unlabeled data can be extracted, and adversarial learning further guarantees that the prediction results share similar distributions with the real data. Moreover, a neural network visualization method is adopted to show that the proposed CNN model can learn more distinguishable features than the conventional CNN model. The robustness experiments on synthetic data sets show that the proposed method can achieve better performances than other methods in most cases. And the blind-well experiments on real seismic profiles show that the predicted impedance curve of the proposed method maintains a better correlation with the true impedance curve.}

This algorithm is applied after migration and is computationally efficient. It produces results comparable to iterative inversion but at a significantly reduced cost. In numerical experiments with synthetic and field data sets, the adopted method improves image resolution, attenuates noise, reduces migration artifacts, and enhances reflection amplitudes. We train the network with three different data sets and test on three other data sets, which are not a part of training. Tests on validation data sets verify the effectiveness of the approach. In addition, the field-data example also highlights the effect of the bandwidth of the training data and the quality of the velocity model on the quality of the deep neural network output. }

We adopt the framework of the generative adversarial networks to train the network and add additional loss functions to regularize the model. Numerical examples using land and marine field datasets demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. With minimal computational burden and proper training, the proposed method can be applied to three-dimensional seismic datasets to achieve accurate interpolation results.},

In this work we propose a novel tool for seismic imaging applications based on recent advances in deep neural networks. Specifically, we use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to process seismic migrated images in order to potentially obtain different kinds of outputs depending on the application target at training stage.We demonstrate the promising features of this tool through a couple of synthetic examples. In the first example, the GAN is trained to turn a low-quality migrated image into a high-quality one, as if the acquisition geometry were much more dense than in the input. In the second example, the GAN is trained to turn a migrated image into the respective deconvolved reflectivity image.Presentation Date: Wednesday, October 17, 2018Start Time: 9:20:00 AMLocation: Poster Station 1Presentation Type: Poster }

abstract = {ABSTRACT We propose to adopt a deep learning based framework using generative adversarial networks for ground-roll attenuation in land seismic data. Accounting for the non-stationary properties of seismic data and the associated ground-roll noise, we create training labels using local time–frequency transform and regularized non-stationary regression. The basic idea is to train the network using a few shot gathers such that the network can learn the weights associated with noise attenuation for the training shot gathers. We then apply the learned weights to test ground-roll attenuation on shot gathers, that are not a part of training input to obtain the desired signal. This approach gives results similar to local time–frequency transform and regularized non-stationary regression but at a significantly reduced computational cost. The proposed approach automates the ground-roll attenuation process without requiring any manual input in picking the parameters for each shot gather other than in the training data. Tests on field-data examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACTGround roll is a persistent problem in land seismic data. This type of coherent noise often contaminates seismic signals and severely reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of seismic data. A variety of methods for addressing ground-roll attenuation have been developed. However, existing methods are limited, especially when using real land seismic data. For example, when ground roll and reflections overlap in the time or frequency domains, traditional methods cannot completely separate them and they often distort the signals during the suppression process. We have developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) to attenuate ground roll in seismic data. Unlike traditional methods for ground-roll attenuation dependent on various filters, the GAN method is based on a large training data set that includes pairs of data with and without ground roll. After training the neural network with the training data, the network can identify and filter out any noise in the data. To fulfill this purpose, the proposed method uses a generator and a discriminator. Through network training, the generator learns to create the data that can fool the discriminator, and the discriminator can then distinguish between the data produced by the generator and the training data. As a result of the competition between generators and discriminators, generators produce better images whereas discriminators accurately recognize targets. Tests on synthetic and real land seismic data show that the proposed method effectively reveals reﬂections masked by the ground roll and obtains better results in the attenuation of ground roll and in the preservation of signals compared to the three other methods. }

    abstract = { ABSTRACTMapping of seismic and lithologic facies from 3D reflection seismic data plays a key role in depositional environment analysis and reservoir characterization during hydrocarbon exploration and development. Although a variety of machine-learning methods have been developed to speed up interpretation and improve prediction accuracy, there still exist significant challenges in 3D multiclass seismic facies classification in practice. Some of these limitations include complex data representation, limited training data with labels, imbalanced facies class distribution, and lack of rigorous performance evaluation metrics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) and a semisupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) for 3D seismic facies classification in situations with sufficient and limited well data, respectively. The proposed models can predict 3D facies distribution based on actual well log data and core analysis, or other prior geologic knowledge. Therefore, they provide a more consistent and meaningful implication to seismic interpretation than commonly used unsupervised approaches. The two deep neural networks have been tested successfully on a realistic synthetic case based on an existing reservoir and a real case study of the F3 seismic data from the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The prediction results show that, with relatively abundant well data, the supervised CNN-based learning method has a good ability in feature learning from seismic data and accurately recovering the 3D facies model, whereas the semisupervised GAN is effective in avoiding overfitting in the case of extremely limited well data. The latter seems, therefore, particularly adapted to exploration or early field development stages in which labeled data from wells are still very scarce. }

Outcrop data sets generally have lower power-law exponent values than seismic data sets, consistent with a general decrease in exponent value with decrease in fault size. If such a relationship does exist, then probably it cannot be accounted for by sampling bias alone. We suggest that either: (i) fault size populations are not power-law over a large scale range; or (ii) they are power-law, but at smaller scales show a greater range of exponent values due to spatial clustering.}

    abstract = { AbstractSeismic facies interpretation supports subsurface geologic environment analyses and reservoir predictions. Traditional interpretation methods require much manual work, and they heavily depend on the experience and expertise of the interpreters. We have developed advanced algorithms from supervised deep learning to perform automatic seismic facies interpretations. In deep learning, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and encoder-decoder architectures are widely used for image classification and segmentation problems, respectively. Based on these two architectures, we build a 3D conventional CNN and a conventional encoder-decoder, and then we apply an enhanced encoder-decoder (DeepLabv3+) that integrates superior structures to our research. To train the networks, we develop an effective scheme to automatically and diversely augment data by using well-labeled 2D seismic sections in which facies are divided into nine classes. We perform experiments on the Netherlands F3 data set by training diverse samples and tuning parameters, implement the trained networks on the whole data volume, and then quantitatively evaluate the results. The testing results of the encoder-decoders are more accurate and efficient than those of the conventional CNN, as well as being more consistent with the geologic background. The mean intersection-over-union values for the encoder-decoders are 87.8\% (conventional) and 92.4\% (enhanced), respectively, whereas for the conventional CNN, the value is 67.8\%. Besides, the prediction of one seismic section takes less than 1.0 s for the encoder-decoders, whereas it takes 4.0 min for the conventional CNN. }

The ability of deep learning models to generalize beyond the training and validation data is important for comprehensive earthquake monitoring; this ability furthermore depends on the availability of a sufficiently large and complete training dataset. However, this requirement can prove challenging to meet due to significant effort and time for data collection and labeling. Data augmentation provides an efficient and effective approach for increasing the dimension of training samples and improving generalization to unseen samples. In this paper, we present augmentation methods appropriate for seismic waveforms and demonstrate their ability to reduce bias and increase performance.

However, using a small data set to train the network may cause overfitting, resulting in poor network generalization. To solve this problem, we propose an approach based on the combination of a generative adversarial network and a deep convolutional neural network. First, we used a small noise data set to train a generative adversarial network to generate synthetic noise samples, and then used these synthetic noise samples to augment the noise data set. Next, we used the augmented noise data set and the signal data set obtained through forward modelling to construct a synthetic training set. Finally, a denoising network based on a convolutional neural network was trained on the constructed synthetic training set. Experimental results show that the augmented data set can effectively improve the denoising performance and generalization ability of the network, and the denoising network trained on the augmented data set can more effectively reduce various kinds of noise in the DAS data.}",

ABSTRACT={Data augmentation is a popular technique which helps improve generalization capabilities of deep neural networks, and can be perceived as implicit regularization. It plays a pivotal role in scenarios in which the amount of high-quality ground-truth data is limited, and acquiring new examples is costly and time-consuming. This is a very common problem in medical image analysis, especially tumor delineation. In this paper, we review the current advances in data-augmentation techniques applied to magnetic resonance images of brain tumors. To better understand the practical aspects of such algorithms, we investigate the papers submitted to the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS 2018 edition), as the BraTS dataset became a standard benchmark for validating existent and emerging brain-tumor detection and segmentation techniques. We verify which data augmentation approaches were exploited and what was their impact on the abilities of underlying supervised learners. Finally, we highlight the most promising research directions to follow in order to synthesize high-quality artificial brain-tumor examples which can boost the generalization abilities of deep models.}

The generated phantoms are expected to preserve the same tubular structure, and resemble the visual appearance of the training images. Inspired by the recent progresses in generative adversarial nets (GANs) as well as image style transfer, our approach enjoys several advantages. It works well with a small training set with as few as 10 training examples, which is a common scenario in medical image analysis. Besides, it is capable of synthesizing diverse images from the same tubular structured annotation. Extensive experimental evaluations on various retinal fundus and neuronal imaging applications demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.}

 abstract = {In recent years, deep learning based methods achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, these methods are typically supervised, and require large amounts of annotated data to train. Acquisition of annotated data can be a costly endeavor, especially for methods requiring pixel-wise annotations such as image segmentation. To circumvent these costs and train on smaller datasets, data augmentation is commonly used to synthetically generate additional training data. A major downside of standard data augmentation methods is that they require knowledge of the underlying task in order to perform well, and introduce additional hyperparameters into the deep learning setup. With the goal to alleviate these issues, we evaluate a data augmentation strategy utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While GANs have shown potential for image synthesis when trained on large datasets, their potential given small, annotated datasets (as is common in e.g. medical image analysis) has not been analyzed in much detail yet. We want to evaluate if GAN-based data augmentation using state-of-the-art methods, such as the Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, is a viable strategy for small datasets. We extensively evaluate our method on two image segmentation tasks: medical image segmentation of the left lung of the SCR Lung Database and semantic segmentation of the Cityscapes dataset. For the medical segmentation task, we show that our GAN-based augmentation performs as well as standard data augmentation, and training on purely synthetic data outperforms previously reported results. For the more challenging Cityscapes evaluation, we report that our GAN-based augmentation scheme is competitive with standard data augmentation methods.},

abstract = {The major challenge in applying deep neural network techniques in the medical imaging domain is how to cope with small datasets and the limited amount of annotated samples. Data augmentation procedures that include conventional geometrical transformation based augmentation techniques and the recent image synthesis techniques using generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be employed to artificially increase the number of training images. This paper is focused on data augmentation for image segmentation task, which has an inherent challenge when compared to the conventional image classification task, due to its requirement to produce a corresponding mask for each generated image. To tackle the challenge of image-mask pair augmentation for image segmentation, this paper proposes a novel two-stage generative adversarial network. The proposed approach first employs a GAN to generate a synthesized binary mask, then incorporates this synthesized mask into the second GAN to perform a conditional generation of the synthesized image. Thus, these two GANs collaborate to generate the synthesized image-mask pairs, which are used to improve the performance of the conventional image segmentation approaches. The proposed approach is evaluated using the cell nuclei image segmentation task and demonstrates the superior performance to outperform both the traditional augmentation methods and the existing GAN-based augmentation methods in extensive results conducted using the benchmark Kaggle cell nuclei image segmentation dataset.}

abstract = {Vehicle software architectures have been evolving over the last twenty years to support data-driven functionalities. Several enterprises from different domains are currently focusing on improving their data architectures by re-defining the underlying data models to enable core support for analytics and artificial intelligence. Moreover, a common desire to add clear data provenance and explicit context impulses the field of semantics and knowledge graphs. Nevertheless, in the automotive industry, the scenario of connected vehicles implies extra complexity. Vehicle data has an enormous variety, making it essential to develop and adopt standards. This paper presents aspects of ongoing research at the BMW Research Department regarding a conceptual design for vehicle software architectures in the automotive industry. We discuss the principles of a modern data architecture with particular emphasis on the data-centric mindset. We also explore the current challenges and possible working points as the foundation to move from siloed data towards a so-called AI factory.}
