abstract = {ABSTRACT Hydrocarbon reservoirs are generally located beneath complex geological structures. Frequently, such areas contain seismic diffractors that carry detailed structure information in the order of the seismic wavelength. Therefore, the development of computational facilities capable of detecting diffractor points with a good resolution is desirable but has been a challenge in the area of seismic processing. In this work, we present a method for the detection of diffraction points in the common-offset-gather domain. The method applies a two-class k nearest neighbours (kNN) pattern recognition technique to amplitudes along diffraction traveltime curves to distinguish between diffractions and reflections or noise. While the method, in principle, requires knowledge of the migration velocity field, it is very robust with respect to an erroneous model. Numerical examples using synthetic seismic and field ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) data demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and show its usefulness for automatically mapping diffraction points in a seismic section. In our applications, the method was able to detect all diffractions present in the data and did not produce any false positives.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Diffracted waves carry high-resolution information that can help interpreting fine structural details at a scale smaller than the seismic wavelength. However, the diffraction energy tends to be weak compared to the reflected energy and is also sensitive to inaccuracies in the migration velocity, making the identification of its signal challenging. In this work, we present an innovative workflow to automatically detect scattering points in the migration dip angle domain using deep learning. By taking advantage of the different kinematic properties of reflected and diffracted waves, we separate the two types of signals by migrating the seismic amplitudes to dip angle gathers using prestack depth imaging in the local angle domain. Convolutional neural networks are a class of deep learning algorithms able to learn to extract spatial information about the data in order to identify its characteristics. They have now become the method of choice to solve supervised pattern recognition problems. In this work, we use wave equation modelling to create a large and diversified dataset of synthetic examples to train a network into identifying the probable position of scattering objects in the subsurface. After giving an intuitive introduction to diffraction imaging and deep learning and discussing some of the pitfalls of the methods, we evaluate the trained network on field data and demonstrate the validity and good generalization performance of our algorithm. We successfully identify with a high-accuracy and high-resolution diffraction points, including those which have a low signal to noise and reflection ratio. We also show how our method allows us to quickly scan through high dimensional data consisting of several versions of a dataset migrated with a range of velocities to overcome the strong effect of incorrect migration velocity on the diffraction signal.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACTSeismic structural interpretation involves highlighting and extracting faults and horizons that are apparent as geometric features in a seismic image. Although seismic image processing methods have been proposed to automate fault and horizon interpretation, each of which today still requires significant human effort. We improve automatic structural interpretation in seismic images by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that recently have shown excellent performances in detecting and extracting useful image features and objects. The main limitation of applying CNNs in seismic interpretation is the preparation of many training data sets and especially the corresponding geologic labels. Manually labeling geologic features in a seismic image is highly time-consuming and subjective, which often results in incompletely or inaccurately labeled training images. To solve this problem, we have developed a workflow to automatically build diverse structure models with realistic folding and faulting features. In this workflow, with some assumptions about typical folding and faulting patterns, we simulate structural features in a 3D model by using a set of parameters. By randomly choosing the parameters from some predefined ranges, we are able to automatically generate numerous structure models with realistic and diverse structural features. Based on these structure models with known structural information, we further automatically create numerous synthetic seismic images and the corresponding ground truth of structural labels to train CNNs for structural interpretation in field seismic images. Accurate results of structural interpretation in multiple field seismic images indicate that our workflow simulates realistic and generalized structure models from which the CNNs effectively learn to recognize real structures in field images. }

Avoiding the need to solve the Christoffel equation at each spatial location of the medium for each time slice, we propose an efficient algorithm using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We propose a wave-mode decoupling workflow where we train the neural network using five to six timeslices for a particular source location and test on all other time slices for that source location, as well as for all other source locations that are not a part of training. The benefit of this approach is a drastically reduced computation cost in comparison with that of conventional techniques. Tests on synthetic examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.Presentation Date: Wednesday, September 18, 2019Session Start Time: 9:20 AMPresentation Time: 9:20 AMLocation: Poster Station 13Presentation Type: Poster }
