We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.}, journal = {Math.

abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.}

A mathematical theory for the method as a special continuation approach to global optimization is established. We show that the method can transform a nonlinear objective function into a class of gradually deformed, but ``smoother'' or ``easier'' functions. An optimization procedure can then be successively applied to the new functions to trace their solutions back to the original function. Two types of transformation are defined: isotropic and anisotropic. We show that both transformations can be applied to a large class of nonlinear partially separable functions, including energy functions for molecular conformation. Methods to compute the transformation for these functions are given.}, journal = {SIAM J. on Optimization}, month = mar, pages = {748–768}, numpages = {21}, keywords = {continuation methods, molecular conformation, integral transformation, global/local minimization} }

While the popular techniques for local optimization works well only on relatively smooth functions, functions encoded by real-world programs are infested with discontinuities and local irregular features. Smooth interpretation attenuates such features by taking the convolution of the program with a Gaussian function, effectively replacing discontinuous switches in the program by continuous transitions. In doing so, it extends to programs the notion of Gaussian smoothing, a popular signal-processing technique used to filter noise and discontinuities from signals.Exact Gaussian smoothing of programs is undecidable, so algorithmic implementations of smooth interpretation must necessarily be approximate. In this paper, we characterize the approximations carried out by such algorithms. First, we identify three correctness properties-- soundness, robustness, and β-robustness--that an approximate smooth interpreter should satisfy. In particular, a smooth interpreter is sound if it computes an abstraction of a program's "smoothed" semantics, and robust if it has arbitrary-order derivatives in the input variables at every point in its input space. Second, we describe the design of an approximate smooth interpreter that provably satisfies these properties. The interpreter combines program abstraction using a new domain with symbolic calculation of convolution.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computer Aided Verification}, pages = {277–292}, numpages = {16}, location = {Snowbird, UT}, series = {CAV'11} }

However, theoretical analysis of this method is largely unavailable. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis that provides a bound on the end-point solution of the continuation method. The derived bound depends on a problem specific characteristic that we refer to as optimization complexity. We show that this characteristic can be analytically computed when the objective function is expressed in some suitable basis functions.

We characterize a family of non-convex functions for which this algorithm provably converges to a global optimum. In particular, we prove that the algorithm converges to an ε-approximate solution within O(1 / ε^2) gradient-based steps. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the setting of stochastic non-convex optimization with noisy gradient feedback, attaining the same convergence rate. Additionally, we discuss the setting of “zero-order optimization", and devise a variant of our algorithm which converges at rate of O(d^2/ ε^4).} }

Examples on synthetic and field data sets demonstrate the ability of the method to simultaneously solve for reflectivity and a dynamic, variable frequency wavelet.

    abstract = "{Just as synthetic seismic data can be created by expressing the wave field radiating from a seismic source as a set of Gaussian beams, recorded data can be downward continued by expressing the recorded wave field as a set of Gaussian beams emerging at the earth's surface. In both cases, the Gaussian beam description of the seismic-wave propagation can be advantageous when there are lateral variations in the seismic velocities. Gaussian-beam downward continuation enables wave-equation calculation of seismic propagation, while it retains the interpretive raypath description of this propagation. This paper describes a zero-offset depth migration method that employs Gaussian beam downward continuation of the recorded wave field.The Gaussian-beam migration method has advantages for imaging complex structures. Like finite-difference migration, it is especially compatible with lateral variations in velocity, but Gaussian beam migration can image steeply dipping reflectors and will not produce unwanted reflections from structure in the velocity model. Unlike other raypath methods, Gaussian beam migration has guaranteed regular behavior at caustics and shadows. In addition, the method determines the beam spacing that ensures efficient, accurate calculations. The images produced by Gaussian beam migration are usually stable with respect to changes in beam parameters.}",

    abstract = { Accurate methods for the solution of the migration of zero‐offset seismic records have been developed. The numerical operations are defined in the frequency domain. The source and recorder positions are lowered by means of a phase shift, or a rotation of the phase angle of the Fourier coefficients. For applications with laterally invariant velocities, the equations governing the migration process are solved very accurately by the phase‐shift method. The partial differential equations considered include the 15 degree equation, as well as higher order approximations to the exact migration process. The most accurate migration is accomplished by using the asymptotic equation, whose dispersion relation is the same as that of the full wave equation for downward propagating waves. These equations, however, do not account for the reflection and transmission effects, multiples, or evanescent waves. For comparable accuracy, the present approach to migration is expected to be computationally more efficient than finite‐difference methods in general. }

    abstract = { Wave equation migration is known to be simpler in principle when the horizontal coordinate or coordinates are replaced by their Fourier conjugates. Two practical migration schemes utilizing this concept are developed in this paper. One scheme extends the Claerbout finite difference method, greatly reducing dispersion problems usually associated with this method at higher dips and frequencies. The second scheme effects a Fourier transform in both space and time; by using the full scalar wave equation in the conjugate space, the method eliminates (up to the aliasing frequency) dispersion altogether. The second method in particular appears adaptable to three‐dimensional migration and migration before stack. }

The method involves optimizing simultaneously the end points and several intermediate points along the path and thus lends itself well to parallel computing. This is an extension of the nudged elastic band method (NEB) which is frequently used to find minimum energy paths on energy surfaces of atomic scale systems, often with several thousand variables. The method is illustrated using 2-dimensional systems and various choices of the object function, in particular (1) path length, (2) iso-contour and (3) quantum mechanical tunneling rate. The use of the tunneling paths to estimate tunneling rates within the instanton approximation is also sketched and illustrated with an application to associative desorption of hydrogen molecule from a copper surface, a system involving several hundred degrees of freedom.",

title="On the fast solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations",
journal="Numerische Mathematik",

pages="83--95",
abstract="In a recent paper we described a multi-grid algorithm for the numerical solution of Fredholm's integral equation of the second kind. This ``multi-grid iteration of the second kind'' has important applications to elliptic boundary value problems. Here we study the treatment of nonlinear boundary value problems. The required amount of computational work is proportional to the work needed for a sequence of linear equations. No derivatives are required since these linear problems are not the linearized equations.",
